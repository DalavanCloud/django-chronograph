Chronograph
===========

This project was forked from the django-chronograph project on bitbuckt.

https://bitbucket.org/wnielson/django-chronograph/

Control ``django-admin`` commands via the web.

Creating cron jobs for Django apps can be a pain, annoying and repetitive. With
``django-chronograph`` you simply create a single cron job to run every minute,
point it at your site's directory and run ``manage.py cron``. Then from the admin
you can add jobs.


.. Note::

	``django-chronograph`` supports Django 1.1+.
